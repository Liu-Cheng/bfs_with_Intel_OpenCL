The proposed batch method will expand the edges i.e. the column index array of a 
compressed sparse row graph format. This program is to evaluate the storage 
overhead of the batching on different graphs including Youtube, Pokec, 
LiveJournal, R-MAT-19-32 and R-MAT-21-32. Batch size 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 are 
analyzed in the experiment.
